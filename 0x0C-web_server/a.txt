life isn't meant to be easy, life is meant to be lived.
Try to learn & understand something new everyday in life.
Respect everyone & most important love everyone.
Don’t hesitate to ask for love & don’t hesitate to show love too.
Life is too short to be shy.
In life, experience will help you differentiating right from wrong.
